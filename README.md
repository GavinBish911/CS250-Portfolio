1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves engaging with stakeholders to understand their goals, pain points, and expectations. This information is then translated into clear, actionable requirements for the development team. Creating "user stories" is a key part of this process, as they capture the user’s perspective in a simple format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]." User stories help ensure that the development work is aligned with the actual needs of the users, keeping the focus on delivering value. They also facilitate communication between developers and non-technical stakeholders, making it easier to prioritize and manage features.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is grounded in Agile methodologies, which emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. I start by breaking down the project into manageable tasks, prioritizing them based on value, and working in short sprints to incrementally deliver features. Key Agile processes I plan to incorporate in my future work include continuous integration, where code is regularly merged and tested, and frequent retrospectives, which allow teams to reflect on their performance and continuously improve. These practices help ensure that the final product is both high-quality and closely aligned with user needs.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team's goals, communicating effectively, and supporting your colleagues. It involves collaborating closely with others, being open to feedback, and sharing knowledge to help the team succeed as a whole. In an Agile environment, it also means embracing a mindset of continuous improvement—both personally and as a team. This includes participating in retrospectives to identify areas for improvement, being adaptable to changing requirements, and taking responsibility for delivering high-quality work on time. Ultimately, a good team member is someone who helps create a positive, productive environment where everyone can thrive.
